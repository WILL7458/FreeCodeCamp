        <div class="description">
          <p>Dungeons and Dragons is an interactive role playing game that has been around since the 1970's based upon wargames that have been played for centuries. This game can be played with 2 to 10 players and allows each player to take on a persona and role play with each other in a fantasy, sci-fi or even Lovecraftian setting. </p>
          <p>The only limit to this game is your imagination. Unlike other tabletop games and video games, this amazing adventure primarily takes place in your imagination and the imagination of your fellow players! Become a brave warrior seeking the dragon that killed your family or perhaps the wacky bard looking to make a name for himself in the world. There is no end to the fun that can be had playing Dungeons and Dragons!</p>

             <p>The materials needed to start playing Dungeons and Dragons are very simple, you will need some dice, pencils, paper and for one person to have the "Player's Handbook". That's it! The rest is down to your creativity and sense of adventure! There are a number of other items that can add extra dimensions to your DND night such as figurines and battlemaps, however these are entirely optional! One of the best things about Dungeons and Dragons is it's ease of entering!
