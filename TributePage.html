    <h3 id="headline">Dr. King did so many things to advance the cause of Civil Rights, some of his achievments include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 -</strong>Dr. King as a new minister in hostile Montgomery Alabama organized one of the most effective nonviolent boycotts yet to be seen in America. Starting with the refusal to move by Ms. Rosa Parks, the Bus Boycott eventually resulted in the desegregation of public transportation and discriminitory hiring practices in Montgomery.</li>
      <li><strong>Creation of the SCLC in 1957 -</strong>As a young minister, Dr. King formed with colleauges from the Bus Boycott the first southern black rights organization. Partnering with other civil rights organizations such as CORE and the NAACP, the SCLC was able to push segregation out of the south and facilitate further civil rights conquests for black southerners.</li>
      <li><strong>Desegregation of Albany, Georgia in 1960 </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Desegregation of public facilities in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 -</strong>Using non-violent protest along with intentionally provacative marches, King and SCLC were able to get major public facilities to be desegregated in Birmingham, Alabama.</li>
      <li><strong>The March on Washington and the "I Have a Dream Speech" in 1963 -</strong>Along with CORE, Dr. King helped to organize the March on Washington to put pressure on congress to pass the Civil Rights Act. As the final speaker, Dr. King brought tears to the eyes of listeners with his riveting and emotional oration.</li>
      <li><strong>Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for the work he had done to further civil rights.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Organization and participation in the Selma voting rights movement which eventually led to the passage of the voting rights act in 1965.</strong>
    </ul>
